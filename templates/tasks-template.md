## Implementation Notes

### Task Completion Criteria
Each task is considered complete when:
- All specified functionality is implemented
- Related requirements are satisfied
- Code passes quality checks
- Tests are written and passing (where applicable)

### Dependency Management
- Tasks should be completed in numerical order when possible
- Sub-tasks (X.1, X.2) can be worked on in parallel within their parent task
- Major tasks (1, 2, 3, etc.) should generally be completed sequentially

### Requirement Traceability
Each task includes requirement IDs to ensure full coverage of the requirements document.
